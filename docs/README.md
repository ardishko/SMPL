Hello, welcome to the first page of the docs!

Now, as of writing, there aren't all that many pages (or so I assume it will be the case when pushing these changes.)

First of all, congratulations on taking the step to migrate to flakes. I will be detailing here how you can get started.

- Step 1 / Migrating/Creating your auto generated configuration to SMPL (Detailed in Setup.md) (Required)
- Step 2 / How the configuration schema works (Detailed in Schema.md)
- Step 3 / Organization schemes (Optional, but helpful if read.) (Detailed in Organization.md)

Refer back to this file if you ever get lost.
