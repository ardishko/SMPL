# What is this?

Hello and welcome to SMPL's page, SMPL is a NixOS configuration template deriving from my own personal configuration, which aims to be as organized as possible while not forcing users to abstract everything from the get-go.

This template is not the EXACT same as my configuration for accessibility reasons, but it is derived from it.

# What do I provide?

What this template provides is a general structre to get you started on configuring NixOS with flakes. 

in the `docs/` folder, you can find guides on the following:

- 1. How to migrate your existing NixOS setup without flakes, to this template. (Or how to generate a configuration, if you are doing this in the installer. Preferably, dont do that though. [You might run into this issue.](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/85148))
- 2. What to edit and change during the migration.
- 3. The various ways you can organize this configuration after the setup.
- 4. Centralization (If this repo ever becomes popular, that is.)
